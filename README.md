- 👋 Hi, I’m @GazEcc.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a better programmer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to organise my projects better and focusing on sharpening up my PHP and MySQL skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools and small projects. I'm not the best, but I do want to get better.
- 📫 How to reach me - @GazEccleston on twitter or info@hackerspace.ie
